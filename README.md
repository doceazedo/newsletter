# 💌 newsletter 💌

This is my take on building a newsletter API in Rust while I'm going through the
**[Zero to Production in Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com)** book 🦀

## WTF? 🤔

I'm making an API that lets you **subscribe** to my newsletter, so you can **receive emails** whenever I drop a new blog
post.
But it's not _just_ about newsletters! 🤓☝️ I'm leveling up my Rust game by learning:

- 🦀 The ins and outs of Rust and its ecosystem
- 💪 How to build fault-tolerant APIs
- 🧪 Writing unit and integration tests
- 🚨 Error handling
- 🔐 Authentication and authorization
- 📝 Extensive logging and tracing
- 🚀 Docker, zero-downtime deployments, and CI/CD

## Wanna try it out? 🧪

To get started, make sure you have [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed. Then, just run:

```sh
chmod +x ./scripts/dev.sh
./scripts/dev.sh
```

> [!WARNING]  
> This is a work in progress, no promises it will work at the time you clone it.

## Shoutout to the book📚

If you're into Rust and backend development (or wanna be), check out
the [Zero to Production in Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com) free sample! It's a super hands-on
guide that I've been learning a lot from. Props to the author [@algo_luca](https://x.com/algo_luca) for creating such an
awesome resource (and for offering [PPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity))! 🙌
